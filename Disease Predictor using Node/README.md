# Cancer And Diabetes Prediction System 
A Disease Prediction system is a computerized software which is suited for predicting a person by performing comparisons on patterns based on their data. In this System , Machine Learning Algorithms & TensorFlow were used which are one of the popular libraries for  TensorFlow requirements can be classified into the development phase training the model and run phase running the model on different platforms.
