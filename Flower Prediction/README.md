# Flower Classification
Flower Identification is the first part of this project inorder to classify all the flowers based on  the sepal length,sepal width,petal length and petal width of Flower.We have performed  experiment using Iris dataset.

Machine learning is being used in here which plays a vital role in classification.We got  considerable accuracy and results using three different algorithms Knn algorithm , random  forest and Decision Tree.

### Algorithms used in this project: - 
1. Decision Tree: - Decision tree algorithm falls under the category of supervised learning. They can be used to solve both  regression and classification problems. Decision tree uses the tree representation to solve the problem in which each leaf node corresponds to a  class label and attributes are represented on the internal node of the tree. We can represent any boolean function on discrete attributes using the decision tree.
2. KNN: - K-Nearest Neighbour is one of the simplest Machine Learning algorithms based on  Supervised Learning technique. KNN algorithm assumes the similarity between the new case/data and available cases and  put the new case into the category that is most similar to the available categories. KNN algorithm stores all the available data and classifies a new data point based on the similarity. This means when new data appears then it can be easily classified into a well  suite category by using K- NN algorithm. KNN algorithm can be used for Regression as well as for Classification but mostly it is  used for the Classification problems. KNN is a non-parametric algorithm, which means it does not make any assumption on  underlying data.
3. Random Forest: - Random Forest is a popular machine learning algorithm that belongs to the supervised learning  technique. It can be used for both Classification and Regression problems in ML. It is based on  the concept of ensemble learning, which is a process of combining multiple classifiers to solve  a complex problem and to improve the performance of the model.
As the name suggests, "Random Forest is a classifier that contains a number of decision trees  on various subsets of the given dataset and takes the average to improve the predictive  accuracy of that dataset."
